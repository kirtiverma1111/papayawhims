What are Kaftans? 
A kaftan is a long, loose-fitting apparel with full sleeves, generally made from silk or cotton. It was an antique form of clothing that in fact came from the old world, the ancient Persian world to be precise but then went on to spread across the rest of Central and Western Asian region. It was worn by both Men and Women. However, today It's not only a cultural outfit, but a fashion statement, available in various styles, fabrics, and designs. 

How to Choose the Right Kaftans for Women? 
To wear the right kaftans for women and feel comfortable it is quite important to consider the figure type:-

For pear-shaped girls, it is better to choose kaftans with decoration zones located around the shoulders, besides, avoid tight-fitting fabrics in the hip zone. 
Apple-shaped women look best in V-neck or empire-waist kaftans that slim down their upper part, and it is recommended to not wear bulky material. 
For women with hourglass figures, it is advisable to go for fitted kaftans or those kaftans that come with belts as this conceals the belly area and emphasizes the waist. 
The inverted triangle-shaped bodies must go for kaftans that elongate the lower part of the body and should avoid anything that makes the upper body region look full. 
Short and/ or irregular hemlines of kaftans can be beautifully complemented by petite frames while height can help elongate and rock longer and flowing beauties. 
Choosing clothing in darker colors makes one appear slimmer because the lighter shades of the wall and floor will reflect off the dark colors thus reducing the size of the person. The bold patterns make for more excitement.
